# Ethereum-DAP---Dissertation-Project
This project was my dissertation at university. It is an Etheruem web application than runs on a browser using meta-mask to view, edit and transfer a digital car logbook to prove ownership of a car, AKA smart property. It is just a concept of what I think a blockchain could be used for.
