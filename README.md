# Ethereum-DAP---Dissertation-Project
This project was my dissertation at university. It is an Etheruem web application than runs on a browser using meta-mask to view, edit and transfer a digital car logbook to prove ownership of a car, AKA smart property. It is just a concept of what I think a blockchain could be used for.

I chose to do this project as I wanted to learn new programming languages and technologies in my final year, as I had only learnt Java from previous years at university. I wanted to challenge myself to learn new skills rapidly whilst applying my programming knowledge aquired through learning Java. Due to having no knowledge of Blockchain, JavaScript, HTML or CSS prior,  the project does not have a great deal of functionality, however it is a working blockchain application that runs on an ethereuem network and I am proud to have completed this project.

Technologies used in project: 

Ethereum (Blockchain)
Solidity
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

This application will not be able to run without setting up node modules, meta-mask, or a test blockchain network. This is just to demonstrate the code written for this application. Images can be viewed in the final report document.
